Littel about this paper
        In the past, every recommendation task needed a different special tool.

    P5 works for many kinds of recommendation tasks all at once: rating prediction, suggesting the next item, summarizing reviews, generating explanations, and direct recommendations.

    It does this by turning every task into a “fill-in-the-blank” or question-answering challenge.

      Data  Used
    All information—user details, product descriptions, past activity—is turned into short sentences or prompts.

    Example:

    “Which star rating will user John give to the movie 'Avatar'?”

    The answer (target) might be "5 stars"

    P5 starts by learning from lots of examples—these are questions and answers based on real user behavior.

    It uses a language model backbone (like T5) that has already been trained to understand and generate text.

    It learns  facts and  patterns, like what people tend to like after watching certain movies or what explanations sound convincing.

    5. Making Predictions

    It can suggest products, predict ratings, summarize reviews, or explain reasons for choices.
