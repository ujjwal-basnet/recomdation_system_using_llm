Curse of Dimensionality


for 10,000 movies and 5,000 users 

our item matrix would be  = 10, 000 * 5 , 000 
                         = 500, 000


    if each user has rated only 100 movies on average, then only 5000×100=500,000 cells would have values.
    
     The remaining 49,500,000 cells are empty! This extreme sparsity makes it difficult to find meaningful relationships directly.



    or 
    If User A and User B have rated only 10 movies in common out of 10,000, how similar are they? It's hard to tell when almost all data is missing. The "distance" between users or items becomes less meaningful because there are so many dimensions where they have no common data.

 Dimensionality Reduction (Matrix Factorization)


Instead of 10,000 movie dimensions, we reduce it to, say, 50 latent factors.

Our User Matrix (U) becomes 5000×50.

Our Item Matrix (V) becomes 10000×50.

Now, each user is represented by a 50-dimensional vector (their preferences across 50 latent factors), and each movie is represented by a 50-dimensional vector (its characteristics across 50 latent factors).

Addressing Sparsity: Even though the original matrix was sparse, the latent factor matrices are dense. Every user has a value for every latent factor, and every movie has a value for every latent factor. This dense representation captures underlying patterns even from sparse observations.

Reduced Complexity: Operations on 50-dimensional vectors are much faster than on 10,000-dimensional vectors. This significantly reduces computational load.

Mitigating Overfitting: By forcing the model to represent the data in a much lower-dimensional space, it's compelled to learn the most significant underlying patterns rather than simply memorizing individual ratings. This helps in generalizing better to new data.
